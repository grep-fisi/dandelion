## Acknowledgements

This project was funded by Huawei as part of the Huawei LATAM 2023 competition, where it reached the semifinals in China. The competition was highly selective, allowing only two representative groups per university across Latin America. Our team from the National University of San Marcos, one of Peru's most prestigious universities, was the only team from our institution to pass the tests and advance to the semifinals. We extend our gratitude to Huawei for their support and to our university for their encouragement.
